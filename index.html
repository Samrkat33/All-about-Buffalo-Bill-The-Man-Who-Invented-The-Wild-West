<h1>All about Buffalo Bill, the man who invented the Wild West</h1>

<p>Buffalo Bill, or more formally known as William F. Cody, was the inventor of what is known today as the Wild West. While reading his biography written by Candace Fleming, the most interesting thing that stood out to me is how he got the nickname Buffalo Bill. For example, in the book that Fleming wrote called, "Presenting Buffalo Bill, The Man Who Invented The Wild West," it states, "According to Will, Comstock was infuriated by Will’s use of the nickname and proposed a contest.”(Fleming 82)This is what was said by Cody to have happened, and Cody ended up winning the contest against William Comstock. However, in the section, “-Panning For The Truth- Winning The Name ‘Buffalo Bill’”, it says, “And then there is William Comstock himself. In 1868- The year Bill Cody claims the contest took place- Comstock was wanted for murder. It’s doubtful a man running from the law would have appeared at such a well-advertised, well-attended event. And if he did, it’s strange that he never made mention of the contest.”(Fleming 85)</p>
