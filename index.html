<h1>All about Buffalo Bill, the man who invented the Wild West</h1>

<p class="paras">Buffalo Bill, or more formally known as William F. Cody, was the inventor of what is
  known today as the Wild West. While reading his biography written by Candace Fleming,
  the most interesting thing that stood out to me is how he got the nickname Buffalo Bill.
  For example, in the book that Fleming wrote called, "Presenting Buffalo Bill, The Man
  Who Invented The Wild West," it states, "According to Will, Comstock was infuriated
  by Will’s use of the nickname and proposed a contest.”(Fleming 82)This is what was said
  by Cody to have happened, and Cody ended up winning the contest against William Comstock.
  However, in the section, “-Panning For The Truth- Winning The Name ‘Buffalo Bill’”, it
  says, “And then there is William Comstock himself. In 1868- The year Bill Cody claims the
  contest took place- Comstock was wanted for murder. It’s doubtful a man running from the
  law would have appeared at such a well-advertised, well-attended event. And if he did, it’s
  strange that he never made mention of the contest.”(Fleming 85)<img src= "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTIwNjA4NjMzNzc0OTY2Mjg0/buffalo-bill-cody-9252268-2-raw.jpg" alt="picture of buffalo bill" width="500"></p>


<p>However, this was not the first time Cody told people a skepical story. He told the public that he used to work in the Pony
 Express, one of the most dangerous jobs you could have at the time, and said, "Will had given his word of honor to always move
the mail through. So ignoring his weariness, he struggled on. Changing horses, he rode the eighty-five miles to Rocky Ridge. Then
, still without rest, he turned around and rode all the way to his home station of Red Butte- A total of 322 miles. It was the
third-longest Pony Express ride on record, Will claimed, and he made it in twenty-one hours and forty minutes.”(Fleming 59)"
 However, Cody's stories can be countered, such as the claim that the ride was the 3rd longest in the history of the 
pony express, or even the claim that he worked for the Pony Express. Both of these stories had no ratification from the Pony Express, 
which makes it very hard to believe for the public now, but not back when he told his stories about the Pony Express.
